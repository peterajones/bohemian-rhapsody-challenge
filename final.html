          <div class="strof">
            <span>Is this the real life?</span><br />
            <span>Is this just fantasy?</span><br />
            <span>Caught in a landslide</span><br />
            <span>No escape from reality</span><br />
            <span>Open your eyes</span><br />
            <span>Look up to the skies and see</span><br />
            <span>I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy</span><br />
            <span>Because I'm easy come, easy go</span><br />
            <span>A little high, little low</span><br />
            <span>Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me</span><br />
          </div>
          <div class="strof">
            <span>Mama, just killed a man</span><br />
            <span>Put a gun against his head</span><br />
            <span>Pulled my trigger, now he's dead</span><br />
            <span>Mama, life had just begun</span><br />
            <span>But now I've gone and thrown it all away</span><br />
            <span>Mama, oh oh </span><br />
            <span>Didn't mean to make you cry</span><br />
            <span>If I'm not back again this time tomorrow</span><br />
            <span>Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters</span><br />
          </div>
          <div class="strof">
            <span>Too late, my time has come</span><br />
            <span>Sends shivers down my spine</span><br />
            <span>Body's aching all the time</span><br />
            <span>Goodbye everybody I've got to go</span><br />
            <span>Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth</span><br />
            <span>Mama, oh oh (anyway the wind blows)</span><br />
            <span>I don't want to die</span><br />
            <span>Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all</span><br />
          </div>
          <div class="strof">
            <span>I see a little silhouetto of a man</span><br />
            <span>Scaramouch, Scaramouch will you do the Fandango</span><br />
            <span>Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me</span><br />
            <span>Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, figaro, magnifico</span><br />
          </div>
          <div class="strof">
            <span>I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me</span><br />
            <span>He's just a poor boy from a poor family</span><br />
            <span>Spare him his life from this monstrosity</span><br />
            <span>Easy come easy go will you let me go</span><br />
            <span>Bismillah, no we will not let you go, let him go</span><br />
            <span>Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go</span><br />
            <span>Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go</span><br />
            <span>(Will not let you go) let me go (never, never let you go) let me go (never let me go)</span><br />
            <span>Oh oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no</span><br />
            <span>Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go</span><br />

          </div>
          <div class="strof">
            <span>So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye</span><br />
            <span>So you think you can love me and leave me to die</span><br />
            <span>Oh baby can't do this to me baby</span><br />
            <span>Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here</span><br />
          </div>

            <span>Nothing really matters </span><br />
            <span>Nothing really matters to me</span><br />
            <span>Anyway the wind blows</span><br />
