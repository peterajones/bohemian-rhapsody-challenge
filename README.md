## `Bohemian Rhapsody Challenge`

### `What is this?`

I was watching a British quiz show on YouTube the other day called 'Pointless Celebrities' which was the inspiration for this project (you can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6HlbOrjgac) - the 'Rock Lyrics' quiz starts @21:09).

The object of this quiz is to name as many words in the song 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by [Queen](https://www.google.com/search?q=Queen+(band)&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLQz9U3SMo2LFjEyhNYmpqap6CRlJiXogkAEwyIoBsAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZuqGnq9biAhWs1VkKHT4ZBDQQMTAAegQIChAF) of six or more letters. That got me thinking that someone had to get the original lyrics, eliminate all the words with less than six letters and remove any duplicates leaving a short list of all words of six or more letters. We would then have a definitive list which we can use to judge the results of the contestant's answers.

That got me thinking... I could use javascript to massage the text and output a list of all the words containg six or more letters!

I had a lot of fun figuring this out so I decided to document what I did.
