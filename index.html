        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
          I was watching a British quiz show on YouTube the other day called 'Pointless Celebrities' which was the
          inspiration for this project (you can see it
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6HlbOrjgac" target="_new">here</a> - the 'Rock Lyrics' quiz starts
          @21:09).
        </p>
        <p>
          The object of this quiz is to name as many words in the song 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by
          <a
            href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Queen+(band)&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLQz9U3SMo2LFjEyhNYmpqap6CRlJiXogkAEwyIoBsAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZuqGnq9biAhWs1VkKHT4ZBDQQMTAAegQIChAF"

          of six or more letters. That got me thinking that someone had to get the original lyrics, eliminate all the
          words with less than six letters and remove any duplicates leaving a short list of all words of six or more
          letters. We would then have a definitive list which we can use to judge the results of the contestant's
          answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          That got me thinking... I could use javascript to massage the text and output a list of all the words containg
          six or more letters!
        </p>
        <p>I had a lot of fun figuring this out so I decided to document what I did.</p>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Get the lyrics:
            <a
              href="// https://www.google.com/search?q=bohemian+rhapsody+lyrics&oq=boh&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j46j0j46j0.2260j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"

              >Google</a
            >
            They are listed below as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Convert the text to a javascript array of strings where each line is a separate string. I used
            <a href="https://codepen.io/franciskim/pen/eNjrpR?editors=1111" target="_new">this</a> online tool.

        <h4>Step 3 - remove unwanted characters</h4>
        <p>
          Now we need to remove any characters from the string that aren't letters except the apostrophe in
          contractions and of course the space between the words - we need that. Then we can convert the cleaned up
          string to an array of single words.<br />Total word count: 378 words.

        <h4>Step 4 - remove duplicated words</h4>
        <p>
          It's time to get all of the unique words. One way of doing this is to is to use the 'Set' object which lets
          you store unique values of any type. 'Set' will automatically remove any duplicates for us.<br />Total
          unique word count: 168 words. 210 duplicated words have been removed from the array.<br />

        <h4>Step 5 - create a new array of unique words with six or more letters</h4>
        <p>
          So now we have an array of 168 unique words of varying length but we only need the words that have six or more
          letters. A simple 'for' loop will help us find those words. Create a new array called sixOrMore and push to
          that array all of the words that have six or more letters.<br />The result will be 45 unique words of six
          letters or more.

        <h4>Step 6 - add the list of unique six letter words to your HTML document.</h4>
        <p>
          This is one way of showing the results. You could also create an unordered or ordered list for example, but
          this page is already really long, so I put a 'span' around each word and added them all to a paragraph tag.
